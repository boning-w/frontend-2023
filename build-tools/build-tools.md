# Build Tools

Build tools are some frontend developing tools that can make building projects easier and more automated.

## Linters and Formatters

A linter is a tool used to analyze code and discover bugs, syntax errors, stylistic inconsistencies, and suspicious constructs. Popular linters for JavaScript include ESLint, JSLint, and JSHint.

A formatter is a tool used to format your code automatically. It can standardize the formatting of code across a project or team, making it easier to read and understand code.

### ESLint

With ESLint you can impose the coding standard using a certain set of standalone rules.

### Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, YAML, Markdown, GraphQL Schemas. By far the biggest reason for adopting Prettier is to stop all the on-going debates over styles.

## Task Runners

2. [yarn script](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/run/#toc-yarn-run-script)

## Module Bundlers

A module bundler is a tool that takes pieces of JavaScript and their dependencies and bundles them into a single file, usually for use in the browser. You may have used tools such as Browserify, Webpack, Rollup or one of many others.

It usually starts with an entry file, and from there it bundles up all of the code needed for that entry file.

### esbuild

Our current build tools for the web are 10-100x slower than they could be. The main goal of the esbuild bundler project is to bring about a new era of build tool performance, and create an easy-to-use modern bundler along the way.

### Webpack

Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

### Rollup

Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application.
